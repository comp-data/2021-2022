    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a powerful tool developed for data analysis and data manipulation which is used in several Data Science projects due to its flexibility. It is accompanied by a great [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html), [tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/), a [cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/cookbook.html), an [API documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html), other free books (e.g. [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html)), and several articles on the topic (e.g. [those available](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?search=pandas) in [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org)). \n",

Each item in the series is indexed by a specific label (it can be an integer, a string, etc.), that can be used to access such item. If no index is specified, the class `Series` will create such an index automatically using non-negative numbers (i.e. starting counting elements from 0). \n",

The first column defines the indexes used to label each element of the series, which are listed in the second column. Finally, there is an indication of which kind of object are included in the series. In particular, in Pandas, the `object` data type (i.e. `dtype`) is used to define series that are made of string or mixed type objects. \n",

For instance, to list all the values of the previous series as strings, the parameter `dtype` must be set to the value `string` must be specified. In addition, it is also possible to assign a name (i.e. a string) to the series, using the input named parameter `name`. The use of both `dtype` and `name` are shown as follows:"
