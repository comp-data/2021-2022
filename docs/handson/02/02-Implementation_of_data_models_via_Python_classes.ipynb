    "\n",
    "In Python, as in other [object-oriented programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), a class is an extensible template for creating objects having a specific type. All the basic types of values (e.g. strings, integers, booleans) and the other data structures (e.g. lists, sets, dictionaries) are defined by means of particular classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, each class made available a set of [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)) that allow one to interact with the objects (i.e. the instances) of a certain class. A method is a particular function that can be run only if directly called via an object. For instance, the instruction `\"this is a string\".split(\" \")` executes the method `split` passing `\" \"` as the input parameter on the particular string object on which the method is called, i.e. the string `\"this is a string\"` (defined by the [class `str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) in Python)."

    "For defining classes in Python, one has to use the following signature:\n",

    "class <class name>(<superclass 1>, <superclass 2>, ...):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, <param 1>, <param 2>, ...):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the excerpt above, `<class name>` is the name one wants to assign to a class, while `<superclass 1>`, `<superclass 2>`, etc., indicate the superclasses from which this class is derived from. In Python, all new classes must be subclass of the generic class `object`. Instead, the indented `def __init__` is a special methods defining the constructor of an object of that class, and it will called every time one wants to create a new object (instance) of this type. For instance, when we create a new set in Python using `set()`, we are calling the constructur of the [class `set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set), defined as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that all the methods of a class, including its constructor, must specify `self` as the first parameter. This special parameter represents the instance of the class in consideration. In practice, every time we instantiate a new object of that class, `self` will be assigned to that object and provides access to its attributes (i.e. variables assigned with particular values for that object) and methods as defined in the related class. In particular, it is used to access to all object related information within the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, by using such a `self` parameter, it is possible to create variables and associated values that are local to a particular object of that class. In the following excerpt, we use it to define the constructor of the the class `Venue` in the data model shown above as a UML diagram:"

Indeed, I have created a new variable `id` related to the particular object of the class `self` (i.e. `self.id`) and I have assigned a new set to it. Then, I added all the identifiers in the input collection to the set using the [set method `add`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.add) (i.e. via the instruction `self.id.add(identifier)`.\n",

Of course, I could also use a different structure to store this information - for instance, I could use again a set which contained only one value in it.
