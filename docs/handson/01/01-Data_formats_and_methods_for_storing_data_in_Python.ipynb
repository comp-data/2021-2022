    "The first and simplest format you can use to store and load data in Python is the [Comma-Separated Values (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). In practice, each CSV file defines a table of a fixed number of columns where each row represents a (subject) entity and each cell defines the (object) value associated to that entity via the predicate defined by the column label, if specified. While it is not mandatory to specify column labels, it makes a CSV file more understandable to humans and machines. These labels can be specified using the first row of a CSV, defining an header of the table represented. An example of a table represented with a CSV is shown as follows."

    "\n",
    "1. the first positional parameter must contain the path of the file one wants to open;\n",
    "2. the second positional parameter is the mode used to open the file (`\"r\"` stands for read, `\"w\"` for write, etc.);\n",
    "3. the named parameter `encoding` specifying the encoding to open the file (`\"utf-8\"` must be used, if you do not want to have issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, all file objects one wants to create in Python to process files stored in the file system must be also closed once all the operations on that file are concluded. The keyword `with` used with the function `open` allows one to handle the opening and closing of the file object automatically. In practice, once all the operation within the `with` block are executed, the related file object will be closed. Finally, the file object openned using the function `open` will be assigned to the variable that follows the keyword `as`, i.e. `f` in the example above.

    "### CSV dialects\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections we showed how to use the classes and functions in the package `csv` in Python to handle CSV documents. It is worth mentioning, though, that CSV has several [dialects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#dialects-and-formatting-parameters) that introduce small changes in the structure of a CSV document. For instance, a well-known dialect is named [Tab-separated Values (TSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values). Here the idea is that one has to use the [tab character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters) to separate the cells of a row instead of the comma. As such, the comma does not have any specific meaning and can be safely used in cell values withou escaping it with quote characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the very first example of CSV table introduced at the beginning of this tutorial can be [represented in TSV](01-example.tsv) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "column name\tanother name, with a comma\n",
    "a value\ta value, with a comma\n",
    "a quoted \"value\"\ta quoted \"value\", with a comma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the `csv` package allows one to parse also these additional kinds of formats. Indeed, all the constructors of readers and writers objects (i.e. `reader`, `writer`, `DictReader` and `DictWriter`) can have in input the optional named parameter `dialect` which permits the specification of the dialect to consider for either loading or storing the CSV-like table. For instance, the following code stores the table considered in the previous excerpt of code as a TSV file:"

    "\n",
    "Another format well-known in the Web, since it is used in several different scenarios that concern data interchange, is the [Javascript Object Notation (JSON)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). It is a simple textual format to describe objects which follow the key-value approach to specify data, where the key is always a term written within quotes, while the value can assume any of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numbers (integers and floats), specified straight without an markup (e.g. `3` or `3.14`);\n",
    "* strings, specified between double quotes (e.g. `\"a string\"`);\n",
    "* booleans, the values `true` and `false`;\n",
    "* object, a collection of key-value pairs specified within curly brackets, where each pair is separated with a comma (e.g. `{ \"given name\": \"Silvio\", \"family name\": \"Peroni\" }`);\n",
    "* the null value, i.e. `null`, which mimic the `None` value in Python;\n",
    "* arrays, i.e. lists of values (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, other arrays, etc.) listed between square brackets where each item is separated with a comma (e.g. `[ \"a string\", \"another string\", 4, 4.5, true ]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, instead of CSV documents in which all the values are actually interpreted as strings, in a JSON document all the values can have different types, as shown above. In addition, each JSON document does not contain necessarily one single object (using curly brackets), but can be defined as an array of objects, and each object can contain (as some of its values) other objects, organising a tree-like structure. An example of such structure is shown in the [exemplar JSON file](01-publications-venues.json) provided in this tutorial, where all the publications and venues specified in the CSV files introduced at the very beginning of the tutorial have been reorganised according to the JSON syntax. As before, to open it as a source file, you can right-click on it in the left panel and select *Open With -> Editor*."

    "The parameter `ensure_ascii` (assigned to `True` by defalut) is responsible to keep every string value compliant with the [ASCII character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), which will result in escaping all non-ASCII characters (that are only 128 characters). This is very undesirable when we have natural language text in the JSON object we want to store since, for instance, all the characters with accents (e.g. `\"è\"`) will be encoded in a different way (in the example, `\"\\u00e8\"`, that is the UTF-8 code of the character `\"è\"`). That is why the code above sets the `ensure_ascii` input parameter to `False`: to avoid such an escaping, preserving the original characters as they are (i.e. encoded in UTF-8).\n",
