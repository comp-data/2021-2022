    "Often, when you have to deal with and reuse existing data, the answer to a query can be possible only by combining data available in different databases. In addition, such databases can expose their data using different technologies (e.g. an SQLite database and an RDF triplestore). Thus, it is important to have a smooth method that allows one to take data from different sources, to expose these data according to a similar interface, and finally to make some additional operation on these data that, in principle, can be seen as coming from a unique abstract source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, thanks to its standard library and additional plugins developed for it, enables us to use it as a proxy model for getting and comparing data coming from different sources (and even different formats). A few tutorials ago, indeed, we have seen how to read data stored as CSV documents using Pandas. We can use similar functions to read a result of a query sent to a database as it is a source of information. In this tutorial, we see how to do it with SQLite and Blazegraph, i.e. the two databases used in the previous tutorials."

This function takes in input two mandatory parameters that are the SQL query to execute on the database and the connection to it, and returns a data frame built on the data and the parameter specified in the SQL query. For instance, the following code takes the title of all the journal articles included in the table `JournalArticle`:"

    "## Combining data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we have introced how to obtain data from existing databases and how to manipulate them using Pandas. However, in real case scenarios, an answer to a certain query can arrive only from mixing partial data from two distinct databases. Thus, it is important to implement some mechanisms to mash data up together, clean them if needed (e.g. removing duplicates), and to return them in a certain order (e.g. alphabetically). Of course, Pandas can be used to perform all these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to find, by querying all the databases, all the titles and year of publication of all publications they contain (independently from their type), ordered from the oldest one to the newest one. To simplify the job for this tutorial, we could consider the two data frames computed before, i.e. `df_journal_article_sql` and `df_publications_sparql`, as the two coming from two different databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need something that allows us to concat two or more data frames together. However, in order to do that, it is important that, first of all, all the data frames to contact share the same columns. Thus, if necessary, it is important to rename the columns as we have seen in a previous tutorial. In this case, instead, we have already created the data frames with the same column names and, as such, we can proceed with the concat operation, i.e. obtaining a new data frame by concatenating the rows contained in both the data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is implemented by the [function `concat`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html), that takes in input a list of data frames and return a new data frame with all the rows concatenated. In addition, it can also take in input the named parameter `ignore_index` that, if set to `True`, will reindex all the rows from the beginning in the new data frame, as shown in the following code:"
