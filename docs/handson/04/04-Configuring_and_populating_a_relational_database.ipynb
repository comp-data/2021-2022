    "## SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) which can be embedded into the end program and does not follow a classic clientâ€“server architecture, where the server database is independent and is actually accessed by client programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes [SQLite within its standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) - it means that you can create and modify SQLite database directly from Python code. This simplifies a lot the first approach to DBMS, as we will see in the following sections. In addition, there are already several [documents on how to use SQLite in Python](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-sqlite3-module-in-python-3) that are worth of reading to get more details about the features it provides. In this tutorial, we will see the main constructs used to create a database and populate it with tables."

    "First of all, we have to import functions defined in the [`sqlite3` package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) in order to use its classes to create and execute operations on a database. The first thing we need, in particular, is to use the [class `Connection`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection). This class is responsible to connect to a particular database defined as a file. In SQLite, any database is actually stored in one single `.db` file. A new object having class `Connection` is created by calling the [function `connect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect), as shown as follows:"

    "As you can see, the way we use a new connection to a database is similar to what we have seen with files in previous tutorials, using the instruction `with` that allows us to close the connection to the database when all the operations with it have been executed. Before closing the connection, though, it is crucial to run the [method `commit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.commit) in order to commit the current [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction) (i.e. the set of operations that may have changed the status of a database) to the database itself. Of course, it is possible to call the method `commit` more than once during the lifespan of a connection. In practice, you can call it every time you execute an operation that modifies the status of the database, in order to record such modification into the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the `.db` file specifed as input of the function `connect` is created if no database is available with that name in the path specified. However, if such a file already exists, it will be loaded by the connection with the information it already stores."

    "## From a diagram to tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting populating the database, it is necessary to create the appropriate tables that enable the description of all the entities (and related data) we need. In order to understand what to do, it is important to look at the UML diagram describing the data model introduced in a previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML diagram of a data model](../02/uml.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different strategies that we can follow to crete the tables describing a data model such as that deiscribed above. For instance, we can approach such a translation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a table for each class which does not have any subclass (i.e. the most concrete classes), by using as columns all single-valued attributes and relations defined in such a class and all its superclasses. Concretely, we create four tables, i.e. for `JournalArticle` and `BookChapter` (which inherit all the attributes and relations of `Publication`), and `Journal` and `Book` (which inherit all the attributes and relations of `Venue`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each of the tables above, add also a new column that enables us to specify an internal identifier we use to clearly identify all the entities of the various types. In this case, it is enough to add an additional column in each table, e.g. `internalId`. Suggestion: having an internal identifier which is globally unique in the database is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep in mind that the value of all the columns related to relations must point to an internal identifier defined in some of the tables. For instance, the column `publicationVenue` in the table `JournalArticle` will contain an internal identifier of a journal as defined in the column `internalId` of the table `Journal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a two column table, where the first column enables the identification of an internal identifier of an entity specified in the other tables, for each multivalued attribute or relation in the diagram. In the example, only the attribute `id` of the class `Venue` is multivalued, and thus an additional table `VenueId` is created to link a `Venue` entity with one or more identifiers characterising it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible translation of the UML diagram above following the rules just mentioned is shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![tables to represent the data model mentioned above](../04/tables.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that this is not the only possible way to translate the original UML data mode, and other paths can be followed to this respect."

    "Pandas makes available specific methods that simplify the creation and population of database tables via `DataFrame`, and that take care also of running some database-related operations such as the `commit` shown above. The main tool to use to push a table into a SQLite database is the [method `to_sql`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html) of the class `DataFrame`.

This method takes in input two mandatory parameters (identifying the name of the table in the database and the database connection) plus a series of optional named parameters, among which the parameter `if_exists` that, when set to `\"replace\"`, replaces the values in an existing database table having the same name with the new data, and the parameter `index` that, when set to `False`, does not add the data frame index in the database. Thus, adding the five tables to the SQLite database created at the very beginning can be done running the following commands:"
