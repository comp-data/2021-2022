    "## What is RDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) is a high-level data model (some times it is improperly called \"language\") based on triples *subject-predicate-object* called statements. For instance, a simple natural language sentence such as <span style=\"color: red\">*Umberto Eco is author of The name of the rose*</span> can be expressed through an RDF statement assigning to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=\"color: red\">*Umberto Eco*</span> the role of subject;\n",
    "* <span style=\"color: red\">*is author of*</span> the role of predicate;\n",
    "* <span style=\"color: red\">*The name of the rose*</span> the role of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main entities comprising RDF are listed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "A *resource* is an object we want to talk about, and it is identified by an [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier). IRIs are the most generic class of Internet identifiers for resources, but often [HTTP URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) are used instead, which may be considered a subclass of IRIs (e.g. the [URL `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12807`](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12807) identifies Umberto Eco in [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A *property* is a special type of resource since it is used to describe relation between resources, and it is identified by an IRI (e.g. the [URL `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P800`](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P800) identifies the property *has notable work* - which mimic the <span style=\"color: red\">*is author of*</span> predicate of the statement above).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "*Statements* enable one to assert properties between resources. Each statement is a triple subject-predicate-object, where the subject is a resource, the predicate is a property, and the object is either a resource or a literal (i.e. a string). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different notations that can be used to represent statements in RDF in plain text files. The simplest (and most verbose) one is called [N-Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples). It allows to define statements according to the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# 1) statement with a resource as an object\n",
    "<IRI subject> <IRI predicate> <IRI object> .\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) statement with a literal as an object\n",
    "<IRI subject> <IRI predicate> \"literal value\"^^<IRI type of value> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type (1) statements must be used to state relationships between resources, while type (2) statements are generally used to associate attributes to a specific resource (the IRI defining the type of value is not specified for generic literals, i.e. strings). For instance, in Wikidata, the exemplar sentence above (<span style=\"color: red\">*Umberto Eco is author of The name of the rose*</span>) is defined by three distict RDF statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12807> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> \"Umberto Eco\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172850> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> \"The Name of the Rose\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12807> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P800> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172850> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the relation described by the natural language sentence is defined by the third RDF statement above. However, two additional statements have been added to associate the strings representing the name of the resources referring to *Umberto Eco* and *The name of the rose*. Be aware: literals (i.e. simple values) cannot be subjects in any statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A special property\n",
    "\n",
    "While all the properties you can use in your statements as predicates can be defined in several distinct vocabularies (the [Wikidata data model](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties), [schema.org data model](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html), etc.), RDF defines a special property that is used to associate a resource to its intended type (e.g. another resource representing a class of resources). The IRI of this property is `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type`. For instance, we can use this property to assign the appropriate type of object to the two entities defined in the excerpt above, i.e. that referencing to *Umberto Eco* and *The name of the rose*, as shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12807> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <https://schema.org/Person> .\n",
    "\n",
    "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172850> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <https://schema.org/Book> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we reuse two existing classes of resources included in [schema.org](https://schema.org) for people and books. It is worth mentioning that an existing resource can be associated via `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type` to one or more types, if they apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDF Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "An *RDF Graph* is a set of RDF statements. For instance, a file that contains RDF statements represents an RDF graph, and IRIs contained in different graph actually refer to the same resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "We talk about graphs in this context because all the RDF statements, and the resources they include, actually defined a direct graph structure, where the direct edges are labelled with the predicates of the statements and the subjects and objects are nodes linked through such edges. For instance, the diagram below represents all the RDF statements introduced above using a visual graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An image of the RDF graph presented in the RDF statements above](rdfgraph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Once we have created our graph with all the triples we need, we can upload persistently the graph on our triplestore. In order to do that, we have to create an instance of the [class `SPARQLUpdateStore`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.plugins.stores.html#rdflib.plugins.stores.sparqlstore.SPARQLUpdateStore), which acts as a proxy to interact with the triplestore. The important thing is to open the connection with the store passing, as input, a tuple of two strings with the same URLs, defining the SPARQL endpoint of the triplestore where to upload the data.\n",

    "Then, we can upload triple by triple using a for-each iteration over the list of RDF statements obtained by using the [method `triples`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.html#rdflib.graph.Graph.triples) of the class `Graph`, passing as input a tuple with three `None` values, as shown as follows:"
