# Data Science: project

The goal of the project is to develop a software that enables one to process data stored in different formats and to upload them into two distinct databases
to query these databases simultaneously according to predefined operations. The software must be accompanied by a document (i.e. a Jupyter notebook) describing the data to process (their main characteristics and possible issues) and how the software has been organised (name of the files, where have been defined the various Python classes, etc.).

## Data

Exemplar data for testing the project have been made available. In particular:

* for creating the relational database, there are two files, a [CSV file](data/relational_publications.csv) containing data about publications and a [JSON file](data/relational_other_data.json) containing additional information including the authors of each publication, the identifiers of the venue of each publication, and the identifier and name of each publisher publishing the venues;

* for creating the RDF triplestore, there are two files, a [CSV file](data/graph_publications.csv) containing data about publications and a [JSON file](data/graph_other_data.json) containing additional information including the authors of each publication, the identifiers of the venue of each publication, and the identifier and name of each publisher publishing the venues.

## Workflow

## Data model

![Data model](datamodel.png)

## UML of data model classes

![Data model classes](uml.png)

All the methods of each class must return the appropriate value that have been specified in the object of that class when it has been created. It iIs up to the implementer to decide how to enable someone to add this information to the object of each class, e.g. by defining a specific constructor. While one can add additional methods to each class if needed, it is crucial that the *get* methods introduced in the UML diagram are all defined.

## UML of additional classes

![Data model classes](uml2.png)

All the attributes methods of each class are defined as follows. All the constructors of each of the class introduced in the UML diagram do not take in input any parameter. While one can add additional methods to each class if needed, it is crucial that all the methods introduced in the UML diagram are defined.

### Class `RelationalProcessor`

## Uses of the classes

```
# Supposing that all the classes developed for the project
# are contained in the file 'impl.py', then:

# 1) Importing all the classes for handling the relational database
from impl import RelationalDataProcessor, RelationalQueryProcessor

# 2) Importing all the classes for handling RDF database
from impl import TriplestoreDataProcessor, TriplestoreQueryProcessor

# 3) Importing the class for dealing with generic queries
from impl import GenericQueryProcessor

# Once all the classes are imported, first create the relational
# database using the related source data
rel_path = "relational.db"
rel_dp = RelationalDataProcessor()
rel_dp.setDbPath(rel_path)
rel_dp.uploadData("data/relational_publications.csv")
rel_dp.uploadData("data/relational_other_data.json")

# Then, create the RDF triplestore (remember first to run the
# Blazegraph instance) using the related source data
grp_endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:9999/blazegraph/sparql"
grp_dp = TriplestoreDataProcessor()
grp_dp.setEndpointUrl(grp_endpoint)
grp_dp.uploadData("data/graph_publications.csv")
grp_dp.uploadData("data/graph_other_data.json")

# In the next passage, create the query processors for both
# the databases, using the related classes
rel_qp = RelationalQueryProcessor()
rel_qp.setDbPath(rel_path)

grp_qp = TriplestoreQueryProcessor()
grp_qp.setEndpointUrl(grp_endpoint)

# Finally, create a generic query processor for asking
# about data
generic = GenericQueryProcessor()
generic.addQueryProcessor(rel_qp)
generic.addQueryProcessor(grp_qp)

result_q1 = generic.getPublicationsPublishedInYear(2020)
result_q2 = generic.getPublicationsByAuthorId("0000-0001-9857-1511")
# etc...
```

## Submission of the project

You have to provide all Python files implementing your project, by sharing them in some way (e.g. via OneDrive). You have to send all the files **one week before** the exam session you want to take.
